This directory holds **${count} Kiro Powers** for \`vanguard-frontier-agentic\`, one
per cloud/platform/IaC provider. Each Power is a directory containing a
\`POWER.md\` file with strict-5 frontmatter and steering content.

## What's in here

\`\`\`
powers/
${tree}
\`\`\`

Each \`POWER.md\` declares:

- **Frontmatter (strict-5):** \`name\`, \`displayName\`, \`description\` (≤ 3
  sentences), \`keywords\` (specific, non-broad), \`author\`. **No other fields
  permitted** by Kiro spec.
- **Body steering:** when to engage, routing pattern (\`<provider>-maestro\`),
  live-mutation discipline, provider-specific invariants (e.g. MLPS 2.0 for
  Alibaba/Huawei, Enterprise Project vs IAM scope for Huawei, account-ID
  /region confirmation for AWS).

## How users install

Kiro Powers don't have a one-command marketplace install — the Powers panel
is per-Power directory add. Users clone the repo and add each Power they
need via the Kiro UI:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/VincentChuWaiChow/vanguard-frontier-agentic
cd vanguard-frontier-agentic
\`\`\`

\`\`\`text
2. In Kiro:
   Open the Powers panel → "Add Custom Power" → "Local Directory"
   Paste the absolute path to the Power(s) you need:
      /absolute/path/to/vanguard-frontier-agentic/powers/vanguard-aws
      /absolute/path/to/vanguard-frontier-agentic/powers/vanguard-kubernetes
   Repeat for each provider you work with.
\`\`\`

## How to update

\`\`\`bash
# Regenerate the ${count} Powers from catalog/agents.json + per-provider config:
npm run kiro-powers:write

# Then verify everything is in sync:
npm run validate:kiro-powers
\`\`\`

The \`validate\` chain runs \`validate:kiro-powers\` automatically. The
validator enforces:

- strict-5 frontmatter (any extra field fails)
- lowercase kebab-case names
- name matches directory name
- description ≤ 3 sentences (decimal-aware — "MLPS 2.0" doesn't count as a
  sentence break)
- non-empty keywords list, no broad terms (\`cloud\`, \`devops\`, \`code\`,
  \`agent\`, \`ml\`, etc.) per Kiro's anti-false-activation guidance
- generator in sync (\`--check\`)

## Schema references (official Kiro docs)

- **Kiro Powers repo:** <https://github.com/kirodotdev/powers>
- **POWER.md frontmatter spec:**
  <https://github.com/kirodotdev/powers/blob/main/power-builder/POWER.md>
- **Interactive power builder:**
  <https://github.com/kirodotdev/powers/blob/main/power-builder/steering/interactive.md>
- **Testing a power locally:**
  <https://github.com/kirodotdev/powers/blob/main/power-builder/steering/testing.md>
- **Kiro IDE:** <https://kiro.dev/>

## Design notes

- **One Power per provider, not one mega-Power** — Kiro docs warn that
  broad keywords trigger false activations across unrelated tasks. One
  narrowly-scoped Power per provider keeps activation precise:
  \`vanguard-alibaba\` activates on Alibaba Cloud work only; \`vanguard-aws\`
  never activates on Azure questions.
- **Hetzner and Contabo Powers exist** even though their agents don't yet
  ship Kiro adapter files (their \`harnesses: [codex, claude-code]\`). Powers
  are steering-first — the steering content stands alone. When their Kiro
  adapter files land, the Powers will gain agent-routing as well.
- **No \`version\`, \`repository\`, \`license\`, or \`tags\`** — Kiro spec
  explicitly forbids these fields in frontmatter. The validator fails on
  any extra field.
