## 🏛️ Enterprise Reviewer Notes

- Every claim in these docs is backed by a file path or command you can verify yourself
- Items marked `[NEEDS OWNER INPUT]` require maintainer clarification
- Security posture is documented in [security.md](security/) with adversarial framing
- Supply chain integrity is verifiable: `npm audit signatures` confirms provenance
