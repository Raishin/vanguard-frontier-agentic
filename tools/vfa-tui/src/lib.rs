#![deny(warnings)]

// The library API is internal and not covered by semver guarantees (see README).
// All modules are kept `pub`: integration/property tests (separate crates) import
// 15 of them directly, and the remaining `logging`/`paths` are consumed by the
// sibling binary crate. Narrowing them to `pub(crate)` makes their items dead
// code in the library crate, which `#![deny(warnings)]` rejects — so the public
// surface intentionally mirrors the full module set.
