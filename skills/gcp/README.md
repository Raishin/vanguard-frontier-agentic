## Official upstream reference

When adding or reviewing GCP skills, check the official Google skills repository first:

- https://github.com/google/skills

Use it as the primary upstream reference for GCP-specific workflow ideas, patterns, and alignment with Google-maintained guidance. This local portfolio was bootstrapped from that upstream repository's GKE, BigQuery, AlloyDB, Cloud Run, Firebase, Gemini API, and WAF-pillar skills.

## Portfolio posture

Role-based GCP skills for evidence-backed architecture, operations, security, networking, FinOps, and guarded live-environment operations.

These skills are intentionally conservative:

- prefer `gcloud` CLI and Cloud Console evidence for live GCP state grounding
- prefer read-only discovery before mutation
- require explicit project ID, region (or global scope for VPC), IAM principal, approval, rollback posture, and verification for guarded live actions
- challenge overly broad IAM bindings, SA key sprawl, public GCS/BigQuery exposure, missing VPC Service Controls perimeters, and unclear resource ownership
- note that GCP VPC is **global** — networking mutations can affect all regions; always confirm scope
- use official GCP documentation and live `gcloud` CLI evidence when service behavior matters

Run `npm run validate` after changing cataloged GCP skills.
