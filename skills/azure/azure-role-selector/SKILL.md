# Azure Role Selector

## Purpose

Select the narrowest Azure role and assignment scope that satisfies the requested access without defaulting to broad standing privilege.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user needs to:

- map requested Azure operations to a role,
- grant minimum access to a user, group, service principal, managed identity, or workload identity,
- decide whether a built-in role is enough,
- separate control-plane permissions from data-plane permissions,
- decide whether a custom role is justified,
- choose the safest assignment scope and validation path.

Do not use this skill for tenant-wide governance design, access review programs, or broad RBAC posture critique. Route those asks toward `azure-rbac-review` or a governance-focused skill.

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer Microsoft Learn documentation through the user's configured documentation MCP, then sampled read-only Azure evidence when available, then sanitized user evidence.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If state was not queried or shown, say so.
- Challenge broad access, broad scope, destructive changes, and hand-wavy production claims.
- Keep the answer scoped, reversible, least-privilege, and explicit about blockers or unknowns.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- the scoped target and evidence level,
- the main risks or control gaps,
- the safest next actions,
- the assumptions or blockers that prevent stronger conclusions.
