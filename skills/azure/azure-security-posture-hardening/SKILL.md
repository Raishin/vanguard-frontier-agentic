# Azure Security Posture Hardening

## Purpose

Review and harden Azure platform or workload posture using operator-grade controls:

- least privilege,
- managed identities over stored secrets,
- private access where justified,
- Key Vault hardening,
- policy-enforced controls,
- audit and diagnostic coverage,
- staged remediation with rollout safety.

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks for:

- Azure security baseline or posture review,
- managed identity migration guidance,
- Key Vault hardening or secret-handling critique,
- private endpoint or public exposure decisions for sensitive services,
- Azure Policy or Defender-backed hardening recommendations,
- logging, diagnostics, or auditability expectations for Azure security controls,
- zero-trust-oriented review of platform or workload controls.

Do not use this skill as a full compliance audit, incident forensics runbook, or a substitute for deep service-specific implementation docs.

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer Microsoft Learn documentation through the user's configured documentation MCP, then sampled read-only Azure evidence when available, then sanitized user evidence.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If state was not queried or shown, say so.
- Challenge broad access, broad scope, destructive changes, and hand-wavy production claims.
- Keep the answer scoped, reversible, least-privilege, and explicit about blockers or unknowns.

- [Safety checklist](references/safety-checklist.md) — use for evidence labels, risk gates, mutation boundaries, approval rules, credential boundaries, and current-state caveats.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- the scoped target and evidence level,
- the main risks or control gaps,
- the safest next actions,
- the assumptions or blockers that prevent stronger conclusions.
