# OCI Live OKE Rollout Guard

## Purpose

Act as a blunt OCI guard or router for this domain. Kill unverified readiness claims, broad routing, destructive shortcuts, weak rollback, and source-free operational advice.

Use this skill for:

- OKE rollout promotion or rollback decisions
- DevOps deployment approval-stage review
- canary and blue-green deployment safety checks
- Kubernetes workload health, PDB, and readiness-gate review
- post-rollout verification and rollback planning

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer official OCI documentation, then OCI API evidence through the user's configured read-only OCI MCP when current-state or API-shape evidence is needed, then sanitized user evidence.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If state was not queried or shown, say so.
- Challenge broad scope, broad permissions, destructive shortcuts, production claims, and live-guard dispatch without evidence.
- Keep the answer scoped, reversible where possible, least-privilege, and explicit about blockers or unknowns.
- Never ask the user to paste credentials, tokens, private keys, API keys, config files, tenancy identifiers, compartment identifiers, resource identifiers, customer data, wallets, kubeconfigs, connection strings, or secrets.

Load these only when needed:

- [OCI Live OKE Rollout Guard Operations](references/oke-rollout-operations.md) — use for current service behavior, common failure modes, hard design rules, verification targets, and push-back conditions.
- [Safety checklist](references/safety-checklist.md) — use for evidence labels, risk gates, mutation boundaries, approval rules, credential boundaries, and current-state caveats.
- [MCP and evidence path](references/mcp-and-evidence.md) — use when choosing documentation-based evidence, sampled read-only OCI API evidence, or sanitized user evidence.
- [Workflow and output contract](references/workflow-and-output.md) — use when executing the full review, applying stress checks, or formatting the final answer.
- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) — use when you need the detailed Oracle documentation list or source notes.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- the scoped target and evidence level,
- the main risks, control gaps, or routing decision,
- the safest next actions,
- the assumptions or blockers that prevent stronger conclusions.
