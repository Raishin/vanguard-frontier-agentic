# OCI Maestro Routing Skill

## Purpose

Act as a blunt OCI guard or router for this domain. Kill unverified readiness claims, broad routing, destructive shortcuts, weak rollback, and source-free operational advice.

Use this skill for:

- OCI specialist selection and task routing
- multi-domain OCI task decomposition
- live-guard gate enforcement before routing
- catalog consistency and companion-skill selection
- provider-boundary checks for Azure, AWS, or non-OCI requests

## Lean operating rules

- Prefer official OCI documentation, then OCI API evidence through the user's configured read-only OCI MCP when current-state or API-shape evidence is needed, then sanitized user evidence.
- Separate confirmed facts from inference. If state was not queried or shown, say so.
- Challenge broad scope, broad permissions, destructive shortcuts, production claims, and live-guard dispatch without evidence.
- Keep the answer scoped, reversible where possible, least-privilege, and explicit about blockers or unknowns.
- Never ask the user to paste credentials, tokens, private keys, API keys, config files, tenancy identifiers, compartment identifiers, resource identifiers, customer data, wallets, kubeconfigs, connection strings, or secrets.

- [Safety checklist](references/safety-checklist.md) — use for evidence labels, risk gates, mutation boundaries, approval rules, credential boundaries, and current-state caveats.
- [MCP and evidence path](references/mcp-and-evidence.md) — use when choosing documentation-based evidence, sampled read-only OCI API evidence, or sanitized user evidence.

- [Official sources](references/official-sources.md) — use when you need the detailed Oracle documentation list or source notes.

## Response minimum

Return, at minimum:

- the scoped target and evidence level,
- the main risks, control gaps, or routing decision,
- the safest next actions,
- the assumptions or blockers that prevent stronger conclusions.
