description: Use this skill when reviewing .NET performance posture, Native AOT, and trimming readiness — reflection and serialization hazards, hot-path allocations, async overhead, caching, trim warnings, and benchmark discipline. Trigger when a user provides a .csproj with PublishAot or PublishTrimmed enabled, BenchmarkDotNet results, trim-warning (IL2xxx) output, or hot-path source, asks whether their app is AOT-ready or trim-safe, or makes a performance claim and wants it checked. The central rule: a performance claim is only confirmed when a measured artifact backs it. This skill reviews project files, benchmark results, and source statically; it never runs the application, a benchmark, or a profiler.

# .NET Performance, AOT & Trimming Review

## Purpose
This skill runs an evidence-gated review of .NET performance posture, Native AOT, and trimming readiness. A performance change is only real when a measurement proves it, and an app is only AOT-ready when reflection, serialization, and DI paths survive trimming without runtime breakage. The review catches reflection-heavy serializers and DI paths enabled under `PublishAot` with no source generator, trim warnings (IL2xxx) suppressed instead of resolved, allocations and logging on measured hot paths, performance claims with no baseline or no benchmark, missing startup-time and memory-footprint measurements for AOT readiness claims, reflection without `DynamicallyAccessedMembers` annotations, async overhead misuse, and unbounded caching. Its central discipline: any performance claim presented without a BenchmarkDotNet (or equivalent measured) artifact is downgraded to `inference` and flagged. It complements the C#/runtime skill, which owns general C# correctness; this skill owns performance, AOT, and trimming specifically.

## Trigger conditions
- A user provides a `.csproj` with `PublishAot` or `PublishTrimmed` enabled, a BenchmarkDotNet result file, trim-warning (IL2xxx) build output, or hot-path source.
- A user asks whether their app is Native AOT-ready or trim-safe.
- A user makes a performance claim ("this is faster", "we reduced allocations") and wants it verified or evidence-checked.

## Lean operating rules
- CRITICAL — Treat Native AOT (`PublishAot`) enabled on a reflection-heavy serializer or DI path with no source generator as a build that breaks at runtime once trimmed.
- HIGH — Treat ANY performance claim presented without a BenchmarkDotNet (or equivalent measured) artifact as a finding: downgrade the claim to `inference` and flag it. "It is faster" with no measurement is not evidence.
- HIGH — Treat trim warnings (IL2xxx) suppressed via `UnconditionalSuppressMessage` without a documented justification, rather than resolved, as a silenced correctness hazard.
- HIGH — Treat logging or avoidable allocations on a measured hot path as a throughput and GC-pressure regression.
- HIGH — Treat a performance claim with no baseline as unverifiable — there is nothing to compare against.
- HIGH — Treat a missing startup-time or memory-footprint measurement for an AOT readiness claim as an unproven readiness assertion.
- HIGH — Treat reflection without `DynamicallyAccessedMembers` annotations under AOT or trimming as a member silently trimmed away.
- MEDIUM — Treat async overhead misuse (async wrapping trivial sync work, `Task.Run` on the request thread) as wasted scheduling and thread-pool pressure.
- MEDIUM — Treat unbounded or unkeyed caching as an unbounded-memory and correctness hazard.
- Never recommend enabling AOT for speed with no measurement; never recommend suppressing trim warnings without a documented justification; never recommend disabling a failing gate as the fix.
- Never request secrets, connection strings, tokens, or customer data. Static review only — never run the application, a benchmark, a profiler, builds, tests, or migrations, and never contact live systems.
- Label every finding with an evidence-basis label: `confirmed (benchmark/source provided)`, `inference (no benchmark)`, `assumption (artifact absent)`, or `unknown`.

## Response minimum
Return, at minimum:
- A verdict (pass / pass-with-conditions / block)
- An evidence level
- Benchmark-discipline findings (claims with no benchmark, no baseline — downgraded to inference)
- Native AOT readiness findings (reflection/serialization/DI under `PublishAot`, source generators, startup/memory measurement)
- Trimming findings (IL2xxx warnings, suppression hygiene, `DynamicallyAccessedMembers` annotations)
- Hot-path findings (allocations, logging on measured hot paths)
- Async-overhead and caching findings
- A severity-labelled finding list (critical / high / medium / low), each with an evidence-basis label
- Safe next actions
- Open questions
